This page highlights some of my key research projects, demonstrating the application of computational modelling to address socio-environmental challenges.

### Modelling Returnee Movements to Ukraine (UNHCR Funded Project)

**Description:** Currently modelling the potential return movements of displaced populations to Ukraine using an Agent-Based Model (ABM). The model builds upon frameworks such as the Flee ABM code.

**Focus:** Conducting sensitivity analysis to understand which factors most significantly influence simulation outcomes and assessing the robustness of projections.

**Collaborators:** UNHCR, Brunel University London Computer Science Department.

### Computational Modelling for Humanitarian Challenges (PhD Placement with Save the Children)

**Description:** Placement with Save the Children and Brunel University London, applying computational modelling techniques to humanitarian challenges.

**Focus:** Translating research methodologies to practical, non-academic contexts and collaborating with a major international NGO.

### Other Migration and Disaster Modelling

- **Modelling Flood-Induced Displacement:** Simulating evacuation and migration patterns in response to natural hazards.
- **Understanding Climate-Driven Migration:** Exploring the interplay between environmental changes and human movement.
- **Simulating Community Resilience and Coping Mechanisms:** Modelling community responses to environmental shocks.
