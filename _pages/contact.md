I welcome inquiries from fellow researchers, potential collaborators, and anyone interested in my work. This includes NGOs seeking to apply computational modelling to humanitarian challenges, climate researchers interested in the human dynamics of environmental change, individuals looking to apply Uncertainty Quantification or Sensitivity Analysis to their own codes, and students interested in postgraduate study or research opportunities.

I am also keen to engage with the general public and discuss opportunities for science communication and outreach, as well as potential grant applications and collaborative projects.
