Collaboration is an important and enriching aspect of my research. I engage with colleagues across various academic disciplines, including physics and computer science, to bring diverse perspectives and expertise to complex problems.

I also value working with non-academic partners, particularly NGOs and practitioners, to ensure my research questions are informed by real-world challenges. For instance, I undertook a PhD placement with Save the Children, collaborating with Brunel University London to apply computational modelling to humanitarian contexts. I am currently collaborating with UNHCR on a project modelling returnee dynamics in Ukraine. My collaboration with organisations like Save the Children has also guided research questions and model development related to climate-driven migration and disaster response.

Furthermore, I have collaborated with researchers within large-scale computational science initiatives, such as the ExCALIBUR programme and the SEAVEA project, focusing on Verification, Validation, and Uncertainty Quantification techniques for complex simulations in high-performance computing environments.

I am always open to exploring new collaborative opportunities that align with my research interests.
