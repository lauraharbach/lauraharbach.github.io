My research centres on developing and applying advanced computational models to understand complex dynamic systems. My work spans several interconnected areas:

### Astrophysical Simulations

My foundational research lies in computational astrophysics, focusing on understanding exoplanet atmospheres and their evolution. My Master of Physics (MPhys) year abroad at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics provided early research experience in this field. My PhD research at Imperial College London delved specifically into photoevaporation from exoplanet atmospheres, investigating atmospheric escape driven by intense stellar radiation, with a particular interest in atmospheres that may be water-rich or dominated by heavier elements. I used sophisticated simulations, including Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and hydrodynamic models, to study complex physical systems and phenomena such as the interaction between stellar winds and planetary atmospheres.

### Migration and Disaster Modelling

I apply and develop computational models to explore the dynamics of human migration and the impacts of disasters. A core methodology I employ is Agent-Based Modelling (ABM). My work in this area includes:

- **Modelling Returnee Movements to Ukraine (UNHCR Funded Project):** Using ABM to explore how different factors and evolving scenarios might influence return decisions and patterns for displaced populations.
- **Modelling Flood-Induced Displacement:** Adapting frameworks like the Flee model to simulate evacuation and migration patterns in response to natural hazards.
- **Understanding Climate-Driven Migration:** Developing models to explore the interplay between environmental changes and human movement patterns.
- **Simulating Community Resilience and Coping Mechanisms:** Modelling how communities respond to environmental shocks.

### Computational Methods and High-Performance Computing

A strong emphasis of my work is on computational methodologies, ensuring models are reliable and efficient, particularly on high-performance computing (HPC) resources. I focus on developing efficient simulation code and approaches for understanding and quantifying the trustworthiness of model predictions.

My engagement with initiatives like the ExCALIBUR programme highlights an interest in high-performance and exascale computing. As part of this, I have been involved with projects such as SEAVEA, which develops open-source software tools for Verification, Validation, and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) for complex simulations.

My research involves Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Sensitivity Analysis, which are vital for understanding the range of possible outcomes and the confidence that can be placed in predictions from complex models.
