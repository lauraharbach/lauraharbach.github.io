Hello and welcome to my website. I'm Laura Harbach, a researcher who enjoys applying advanced computational modelling and complex systems analysis to understand pressing socio-environmental challenges. My academic journey began in astrophysics, where I gained extensive experience in simulating complex, dynamic physical systems. I completed a PhD in Physics from Imperial College London, where my research focused on computational astrophysics. As part of my Master of Physics degree from the University of Southampton, I also had the wonderful opportunity to conduct research at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

Today, I translate these quantitative and computational skills to the fields of human migration and disaster modelling. I utilise techniques such as Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) to explore complex population dynamics. You can find details about specific research initiatives on the [Projects](/projects) page. My work also contributes to developing robust computational methodologies for high-performance and exascale computing, focusing on areas like Uncertainty Quantification and Sensitivity Analysis. Learn more about the methods I employ on the [Methodology](/methodology) page.

This website provides an overview of my research interests, academic background, publications, and collaborations. Please explore the pages to learn more about my work in astrophysical simulations, migration and disaster modelling.
