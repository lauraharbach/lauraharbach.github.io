<!-- This page provides an overview of my academic and research journey, outlining my background in astrophysics, computational modelling, and humanitarian research efforts. -->

My academic journey began with a fascination for the complex dynamics of natural systems, leading me to pursue a Master of Physics (MPhys) degree in Astrophysics with a Year Abroad at the University of Southampton. During this programme, I spent a transformative year as a Visiting Student Researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), gaining valuable early experience in conducting astrophysical research.

Following my Masters, I completed a PhD in Physics at Imperial College London. My doctoral research focused on computational astrophysics, specifically investigating photoevaporation from exoplanet atmospheres, including those potentially water-rich or dominated by heavier elements. This involved developing and using sophisticated simulations to study complex, dynamic physical systems and phenomena such as the interaction between stellar winds and exoplanet atmospheres, and how intense stellar radiation can lead to atmospheric escape.

During my PhD, I became increasingly interested in applying these powerful analytical and computational methodologies to contribute to society, particularly in understanding the dynamics of human populations in the face of environmental change and disasters. This interest led me to undertake a placement with Save the Children, working with the Computer Science department at Brunel University London to apply computational modelling to humanitarian challenges as part of my doctoral studies.

This experience marked my transition into research focusing on migration and disaster modelling, where I primarily employ techniques such as Agent-Based Modelling (ABM). My work seeks to apply the analytical power of computational science to better understand and respond to pressing global challenges, bridging insights from fundamental physics to applied socio-environmental research.

Since completing my PhD and during my time at Brunel University London, I have also engaged with large-scale computational science initiatives, such as the ExCALIBUR programme. This national effort aims to prepare research software and algorithms for the exascale computing era. As part of this, I've been involved with projects like SEAVEA (Software Environment for Actionable & VVUQ-evaluated Exascale Applications), focusing on the vital area of Verification, Validation, and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) for complex simulations. I am currently a researcher based at Brunel University London, actively involved in research projects that apply computational modelling to real-world humanitarian issues. You can read more about these projects on the [Projects](/projects) page.
