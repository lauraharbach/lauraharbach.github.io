title: "About Me"
excerpt: During my PhD in Astrophysics, I developed a hydrodynamic model to study water loss from exoplanet atmospheres. I also completed a Dirac Innovation Placement with Save the Children, where I worked on agent-based modelling of migration due to flooding in Bangladesh. Now, as a postdoctoral researcher in computer science, I’m continuing my work in simulation and modelling by working on the SEAVEA toolkit, a Python library designed to enhance the reliability and accuracy of large-scale simulations through verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ). Recently, I’ve been applying the SEAVEA toolkit to a diverse range of applications, from climate change-induced migration to uncertainty quantification in AI-driven drug discovery."
